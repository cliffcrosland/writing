# Writing App (Name TBD)

This is a project management app focused on writing.

Teams do better work when they write well. A five page memo is harder to create
than a slide deck, but it is more valuable: well-written ideas are much easier
to understand.

It should be easy to write in complete sentences and paragraphs. It should be
easy to reference other writing. It should be easy to turn writing into a
project and track its progress.

If the product makes it easy to write well, teams who use it will do better
work.

## Todos
- Establish the Postgres schema for users.
- Create the Rust backend project.
- Create a GRPC server that supports writing operations.
- Create the frontend project. Decide whether to focus on performance with
  Mikado or play it safe with React.
- Choose a good name.
